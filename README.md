# Graph Coloring

### Description

This project utilizes a `graph coloring` algorithm to efficiently organize marine species into separate tanks.
The species and their predation relationships are represented as a graph, where each species is a node and an edge between two nodes indicates a predation relationship.
The algorithm ensures that no species shares a tank with its prey.

**The ultimate goal of the project is to minimize the number of tanks required, thereby optimizing resource usage**.
